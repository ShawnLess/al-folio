Centers around the efficiency and scalability of next-generation micro-processors for the emerging planet-scale applications. With domain specific architecture and kilo-scale networks, *I believe the future heterogeneous manycore micorprocessor would provide unprecedented computation power and efficiency, empowering us to better acquire, process and understand the information of the world.* 

I have spent my last 10 years in pursuing this goal, taped out multiple novel microprocessor along 
with the toolchains/runtime support, 
including the [MaPU](/projects/1_mapu) architecture with Ultra VLIW (14 slots) and CGRA feature, 
and [Celerity](/projects/2_celerity), a 511 RISC-V core chip with record-breaking benchmark scores. 

Recently, I'm interested in open source processor architecture (RISC-V), and hardware/software stack of Domain Specific Accelerator (DSP, Deep Learning, Data Center, IoT).
