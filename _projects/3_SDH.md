title: SDH
description: Software Defined Hardware.</br> I was fortunate to participate the SDH program when I was a research scientist in Michael Taylor's group at University of Washington (2017 -- 2019), leading the hardware and low-level runtime group.

Software Define Hardware (SDH) is one of the **DARPA** [Electronics Resurgence Initiative program](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/electronics-resurgence-initiative), which aims to build runtime-reconfigurable hardware and software that enables near ASIC performance without sacrificing programmability for data-intensive algorithms.

University of Washington is one of the [SDH performers](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/design/darpa-picks-its-first-set-of-winners-in-electronics-resurgence-initiative) to build Polymorphic hybrid ASIC/FPGA architectures based on the [Celerity](/projects/2_celerity.md) fabric.
